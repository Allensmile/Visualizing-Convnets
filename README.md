# Visualizing Convnets

This repository has the code from my O'Reilly article 'Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks w/ TensorFlow' published on.

This code contains tools for building a dataset and a jupyter notebook for implementing and visualizing a simple convolutional neural network.

## Required Packages
* [TensorFlow v1.2](http://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [Pillow](http://python-pillow.org/)

There are two ways you can install these packages: by using Docker, or installing the packages manually yourself.

### Using Docker

You have to download docker yourself from
